<h1>About me</h1>
	I am a first-year Ph.D student in the <a href="http://cps.cse.wustl.edu/index.php/Cyber-Physical_Systems_Laboratory/">Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory</a> with the Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis. My research interest focuses on machine learning for healthcare. Before I joined the lab, I received B.Eng. and M.S. from Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2016 and 2020, respectively. I love Nanjing and I always enjoyed spending the whole Sunday afternoon lying by Xuanwu Lake.  

Fitness and table-tennis are my biggest hobbies. I plan to learn freestyle swimming this year.
